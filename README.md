# DBMS Mini Project

The ATM System is developed using Java swings and back-end database as Mysql.
Java swings is the one of the powerful version of Framework and
object oriented programming. Hence we use this in our project.
The ATM will service one customer at a time. A customer will be required to
enter ATM Card number and personal identification number (PIN) â€“ both of which
will be sent to the database for validation as part of each transaction. The
customer will then be able to perform one or more transactions. Also
customer must be able to make a balance inquiry of any account linked to
the card.
